        <p>Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation, usually by designing and building an executable computer program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms</p>

        <p> accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit.</p>

        <p><span>Q:1</span>Localstorage and sessionstorage difference ???</p>
        <p><span>Ans:</span>SessionStorage is similar to localStorage the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab</p>
        <p><span>Q:2</span>Local scope vs block scope???</p>
        <p><span>Ans:</span>The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the same scope. ES6 introduced block scope by using the let and const keywords</p>
        <p><span>Q:3</span>How does javascript event loop work ???</p>
        <p><span>Ans:</span>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
